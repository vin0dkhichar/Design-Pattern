# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains implementations of common **Design Patterns** in Python with real-life examples.  
Each pattern is implemented in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

| Pattern                  | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decorator**             | Dynamically add behavior to objects without modifying their structure.                          |
| **Factory Method**        | Define an interface for creating objects but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  |
| **Abstract Factory**      | Create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.                   |
| **Singleton**             | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access.                      |
| **Adapter**               | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.                         |
| **Facade**                | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                                         |
| **Template Method**       | Define the skeleton of an algorithm with steps that subclasses can override.                    |
| **Iterator**              | Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its structure.  |
| **Composite**             | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.                      |
| **Composite Iterator**    | Traverse composite structures using an iterator.                                               |
| **Builder**               | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.                         |
| **Command**               | Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients.                      |
| **State**                 | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.                          |
| **Proxy**                 | Provide a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access.                       |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.                              |
| **Flyweight**             | Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.                      |
| **Prototype**             | Create new objects by copying existing ones (cloning).                                        |
| **Visitor**               | Separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.                                    |
| **Bridge**                | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so they can vary independently.                |
| **Middleware (Chain of Responsibility)** | Example of request processing pipeline using middleware pattern.                   |
